            <h3>Using Ultrafast Infrared Spectroscopy to Study Free Volume in Polymer Materials</h3>
            <p>Polymers are versatile materials with many industrial applications such as gas separation membranes and
                dielectric media. They are tolerant to a range of working conditions, and combined with organic
                synthetic chemistry, their chemical structures are tunable to offer a virtually infinite library of
                material properties. Free volume is a key component of polymer membranes. Its characteristics are
                related to, and in some cases dictate, the membrane’s macroscopic properties, such as thermal response,
                viscosity, gas permeability and dielectric response.</p>

                <div><span>Figure 1.</span> Schematic representation of polymer membrane showing FVEs and vibrational
                    probe, PhSeCN, trapped inside them.</div>
            </div>
            <p>Glass forming polymers above their glass transition temperature, Tg, exist in thermal equilibrium, as
                they possess enough thermal energy to achieve the most efficient chain packing. As the system crosses
                below Tg, its viscosity increases rapidly, chain mobility is diminished, and polymer chains become
                locked in an inefficiently packed, high-energy, non-equilibrium configuration. This leaves scattered
                across the matrix a series of “pockets” of unoccupied space called free volume elements (FVEs), which
                span a range of sizes and structures (Fig. 1).</p>
            <p>Using poly(methyl methacrylate), PMMA, and polystyrene, PS, we developed an experimental approach called
                Restricted Orientation Anisotropy Method (ROAM) to measure the size, size distribution, structural
                dynamics timescales, and size-dependent intrinsic electric fields of polymer FVEs. ROAM uses a
                polarization-selective pump-probe experiment to measure the orientational dynamics of a small
                vibrational probe embedded inside FVEs. The vibrational probe is used as a molecular ruler for FVE
                sizes, and its vibrational frequency is used to extract polymer E-fields.</p>

                <div><span>Figure 2.</span> Population decay (i.e., first excited state lifetime) of PhSeCN in
                    poly(methyl methacrylate) and polystyrene. </div>
            </div>
            <p>In time-resolved vibrational spectroscopy, the experimental time-window is determined by the excited
                state lifetime of the observed vibrational mode. Because polymers are slow-moving chemical systems,
                their molecular dynamics are slow, and a long first excited state lifetime is required. The symmetric CN
                stretch of phenyl selenocyanate, PhSeCN, has a vibrational lifetime of >400 ps at room temperature,
                which allows an observation window of over 1 ns (Fig. 2). This property results from the presence of the
                selenium atom between the CN moiety and the phenyl ring. The heavy atom isolates the CN stretch and
                inhibits intramolecular vibrational relaxation pathways, thus increasing the CN’s vibrational lifetime.
            </p>
            <p>The orientational dynamics of PhSeCN inside FVEs are characterized by frequency dependent biexponential
                decays with non-zero final offsets (Fig. 3 A – B). Because the frequency of a particular probe molecule
                is partly determined by the surrounding local electrostatics (see below), different frequencies
                correspond to subensembles of probe in distinct chemical environments (FVEs). The non-zero decay offsets
                indicate that the probe’s reorientation is restricted such that it cannot fully randomize its
                orientation, and the frequency dependence shows that different probe subensembles have distinct
                orientational dynamics. Because orientational restriction results from a collision between the probe and
                the inner walls of the surrounding polymer cage, the extent of decay at each frequency quantifies the
                level of restriction of the probe. Thus, the PSPP experiment unambiguously shows that different
                subensembles of probe molecules are trapped in FVEs of different sizes.</p>
